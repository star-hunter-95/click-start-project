		<h3>Welcome to my portfolio website</h3>
		<p>A quick introduction, My name is Orion, and I go by They/Them pronouns. I’m someone who embraces my unique perspective on the world as an autistic individual, and I’m proud to identify as a bit of a nerd. I’ve always been fascinated by technology, creativity, and how things work, which fuels my passion for learning and exploring new ideas. Embracing my identity and interests has shaped the way I approach both my personal and professional life, and I’m always eager to continue growing and discovering new things along the way. 
		<p>This portfolio is a showcase of the work I've done during the Click Start 8-week course. I joined this course because it piqued my interest, and through it, I’ve gained valuable skills. Now, I’m applying what I’ve learned to help my friends businesses to enhance their digital marketing strategies. </p>
